This code simulates down-conversion of energetic quasiparticles in superconductors, tracking directionality of the secondary excitations. Tools are also provided for sampling initial excitations from dark matter scattering, and for analysis of the results. Please see the [documentation](doc/build/html/index.html) for usage details.
